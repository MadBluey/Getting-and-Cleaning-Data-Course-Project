# How run_analysis.R works  

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each -subject.

## Libraries needed to run the script

- reshape2

Needed for melting and casting dataframes to do more with less code :). 

# Codebook

There is a codebook 'codebook.md' that describes the files and data used.
